2. Change to "NTPSync" directory with ``cd NTPSync``
3. Execute ``android update project -p .`` and ``android update project -p android-libs/Donations``
4. Execute ``ant clean``
5. Execute ``ant debug -Ddonations=all``

## More build information

# Libraries

All JAR-Libraries are provided in this repository under "libs", all Android Library projects are under "android-libs".

## Build Apache Commons Net

1. Download Source zip file from http://commons.apache.org/net/download_net.cgi
2. Strip it down to NTP only:
 * remove src/test
 * remove src/main/java/examples
 * in src/main/java/org/apache/commons/net remove every folder except io, util, ntp
3. execute ``mvn package`` to build jar in target directory

# Use NTPSync in your Android application
You want to query NTP servers from your Android app or set the system clock to NTP time?

This can be done very easy using interprocess communication (IPC) in Android with AIDL. NTPSync provides you with an Interface where your application can connect to.

See https://github.com/dschuermann/ntp-sync/tree/master/org_api_demo for a complete example.

* You need the following permissions in your Android Manifest, adapted to your needs:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="org.ntpsync.permission.GET_TIME" />
<uses-permission android:name="org.ntpsync.permission.SET_TIME" />
```

* copy the following file with the correct path to your project: https://github.com/dschuermann/ntp-sync/tree/master/org_api_demo/src/org/ntpsync/service/INtpSyncRemoteService.aidl
* Connect to NTPSyncs service like shown in https://github.com/dschuermann/ntp-sync/tree/master/org_api_demo/src/org/ntpsync/apidemo/BaseActivity.java
